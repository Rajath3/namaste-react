- Why do we use super(props) in constructor?

Because when we extend the component class from react.component, we have to get the props via parent itself.

- React class based component - lifecycle methods

1. Constructor is called
2. Render is called 
3. ComponentDidMount is called
    - This is mainly used to make API calls, why?. Because we don't wait for page to load after api call, we render, then call api, then re-render component. React main thing is it can re-render that fast and efficiently.
    - This is similar to useEffect Hook.
4. Whenever there are multiple child components to render. React basically renders them in batches and then goes on to commit phase.
    Parent Constructor
    About.js:16 Parent Render

    UserClass.js:12 First Child Constructor
    UserClass.js:20 FirstChild Render
    
    UserClass.js:12 Second Child Constructor
    UserClass.js:20 SecondChild Render

    <DOM UPDATED>
    UserClass.js:16 FirstChild Component did mount
    UserClass.js:16 SecondChild Component did mount
    About.js:12 Parent Component did mount
5. Refer https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/ for react lifecycle method diagram
6. AFter we use setState, the updating phase gets started and ComponentDidUpdate is called after render method.
7. ComponentWillUnmount is called when component is switched to other component.
