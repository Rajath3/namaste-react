- Redux is not mandatory
- https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand Alternative for Redux

- Redux Architecture:
    - Redux is a centralized way of storing States/data.
    - We can have slices inside this. Each slice is logically divided. For example User may be once slice, Cart might be another.
    - So we cannot directly modify any state in redux. Let's say we have a add button on card, there will be dispatcher that triggers an action, the action in turn calls a function to modify slice in redux store.

    Add --> Dispatch(Action) --> Reducer --> Update slice of Redux store

    Cart -->Is subscribed through Selector --> Store

    - that function is known as Reducer.
    - Selector is used for reading data from slice.(This phenomenon is called subscribing to the store).

    - Noted on Redux
        - Subscribe to the correct slice to optimise performance.
        - Older version of Redux didn't allow to mutate the state, but newer one asks us to do so.
        - Redux uses immer js library for mutations. https://immerjs.github.io/immer/
        - Either mutate state or return (to modify original items)
    
    -  Look more Deep clone(Cloning) in JS.
