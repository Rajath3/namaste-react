- Redux is not mandatory
- https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand Alternative for Redux

- Redux Architecture:
    - Redux is a centralized way of storing States/data.
    - We can have slices inside this. Each slice is logically divided. For example User may be once slice, Cart might be another.
    - So we cannot directly modify any state in redux. Let's say we have a add button on card, there will be dispatcher that triggers an action, the action in turn calls a function to modify slice in redux store.

    Add --> Dispatch(Action) --> Reducer --> Update slice of Redux store

    Cart -->Is subscribed through Selector --> Store

    - that function is known as Reducer.
    - Selector is used for reading data from slice.(This phenomenon is called subscribing to the store).
