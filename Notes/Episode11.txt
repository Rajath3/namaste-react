Higher Order Component:
 - Takes a component, enhances it and returns back a new component.

 Pure component:
    - If it is not (behaviour) modified if anything is changed.

Controlled component
    - States/props is controlled by parent
Uncontrolled component
    - Has own States

Lifting state up:
    - Lift state one level up, to control all the children

Props Drilling:
    - Passing props down the children is a problem
    - To solve this we have something known as context
    - We have hooks to create context i.e createContext and useCOntext
    - Suppose we want to access it in class based component, we import the context and use <Context.Consumer>
        {(data) => console.log(data)}
    </Context.Consumer>
    - There is also <Context.Provider>, if we wrap it around components we render. We get context set by this.
