- useEffect Hooked

Syntax

useEffect(() => {}. [])

1. If we just use useEffect(() => {}) then every time the page renders, the useEffect will be called.
2. If we use useEffect(() => {}. []), then the useEffect will be called only on the initial render.
3. We can also have a state variable inside dependency array useEffect(() => {}. [someStateVariable]), so whenever state variable changes, the useEffect will be called.


- useState

1. Don't use inside conditional or declare outside of functional component.

----

React Router Dom

Mainly 2 functions:
1. createbrowserRouter - for config
2. Routerprovider - for rendering


- Anything starting with use , that is a hook. Common convention.
