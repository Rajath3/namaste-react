1. Monolith
2. Microservices

React always try to render whatever it is present and then rerender when api call happens.  

useEffect - As soon as the rendering is finished. The useEffect is called.

Syntax

useEffect(() => {}, []);

Shimmer UI - Display fake UI until page loads.

Why do we use useState and not Js variable?

Because everytime the state variable changes the component is being re rendered.
But that doesn't happen for normal JS variable.
